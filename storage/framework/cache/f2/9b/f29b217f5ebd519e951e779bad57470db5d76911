              <b>AUTOMATION</b><br>
              Automating the software delivery process using continuous integration and delivery pipelines (CI/CD) greatly enhances the team's ability to track and manage feature sets during a sprint. The ideal configuration is where code changes are automatically deployed on approval of pull request (git). The goal being to allow changes to migrate through environments separate from the underlying CMS architecture and content.<br><br>
